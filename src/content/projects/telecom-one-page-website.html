    <p class="mt-6">The process for this project was straightforward and focused on clarity and conversion:</p>
    <ul class="list-disc list-outside pl-5 space-y-2 mt-2">
      <li><strong>Understand & Structure:</strong> I broke down the required content into key sections: a compelling hero, a clear service breakdown, and a simple contact form.</li>
      <li><strong>Sketch (Wireframe):</strong> I created a simple wireframe in Figma to establish a clean, a grid-based layout. This ensured a strong visual hierarchy.</li>
      <li><strong>Design:</strong> I developed the final mockup, focusing on a strong visual identity, readable typography, and a prominent call-to-action (CTA) to encourage user engagement.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3 class="text-3xl font-headline font-semibold mb-2">Research Methodology</h3>
    <h4 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-4 mb-2">User Research</h4>
    <p>Given the project's simplicity, formal user research was minimal. Instead, I focused on stakeholder interviews (3 key team members) to align on the primary goals.</p>

    <h3 class="text-3xl font-headline font-semibold mb-2">User Personas</h3>
    <p>From the stakeholder interviews, I created a persona for a typical customer: a small business owner looking for reliable telecom services. This helped ensure the language was clear, the value proposition was direct, and the contact process was as simple as possible.</p>

    <h3 class="text-3xl font-headline font-semibold mb-2">Outcome</h3>
    <p>I delivered a final layout and mockup that met all the client's requirements. The design was clean, professional, and structured to guide users logically from the service offerings to the contact section, effectively serving its purpose as an informational and lead-generating landing page.</p>

  <div>
    <h3 class="text-3xl font-headline font-semibold mb-2">Future Improvements</h3>
    <p>Moving forward, the website could be enhanced with analytics tracking to monitor user engagement and conversion rates on the contact form. A/B testing different headlines and call-to-action buttons could also help optimize the page for even better lead generation results.</p>
