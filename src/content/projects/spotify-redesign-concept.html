    <h3 class="text-3xl font-headline font-semibold mb-2">Project Overview</h3>
    <p>This is a conceptual UI redesign of the Spotify mobile app. It's a personal project aimed at an existing user base that could benefit from enhanced usability. The main goal was to improve the user experience by refining the navigation, increasing button clarity, and replacing ambiguous icons with more universally understood symbols. While Spotify is a leader in music streaming, I identified an opportunity to improve its mobile UI as a personal challenge. Some of the navigation icons felt ambiguous, and the layout could be tweaked for better one-handed usability. This concept project aimed to address those minor but impactful usability issues.</p>

    <p class="mt-6">My process for this redesign was quick and focused:</p>
    <ul class="list-disc list-outside pl-5 space-y-2 mt-2">
      <li><strong>Understand:</strong> I conducted informal research and gathered personal feedback to validate my assumption that certain icons were confusing to users.</li>
      <li><strong>Sketch & Design:</strong> I jumped directly into Figma to experiment with UI tweaks. My main focus was on replacing unclear icons and improving the clarity of interactive buttons.</li>
      <li><strong>Refine:</strong> I refined the concepts based on the feedback, ensuring the new design felt familiar yet noticeably more intuitive.</li>

    <h3 class="text-3xl font-headline font-semibold mb-2">User Personas</h3>
    <p>Even for a concept project, thinking about the user is key. I created a simple persona for a long-time Spotify power user who values efficiency. This helped me focus on making small, targeted changes that would improve their experience without disrupting their existing mental model of the app.</p>

    <h3 class="text-3xl font-headline font-semibold mb-2">Outcome</h3>
    <p>As a conceptual exercise, the project was a success. It allowed me to practice my UI analysis and redesign skills on a real-world product. The final designs offer a subtle but meaningful improvement to the user experience by prioritizing clarity and ease of navigation.</p>
  </div>
  <div>
    <h3 class="text-3xl font-headline font-semibold mb-2">Future Improvements</h3>
    <p>If this were a real project, the next step would be to conduct A/B testing with the redesigned screens against the current Spotify UI. This would provide quantitative data to validate whether the changes led to faster task completion and higher user satisfaction.</p>
